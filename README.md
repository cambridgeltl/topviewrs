## Key takeaways

> * Define top-view spatial reasoning task for VLMs via 4 carefully designed tasks of increasing complexity, also encompassing 9 distinct fine-grained sub-tasks with a structured design of the questions focusing on different model abilities.
> * Collect **TopViewRS Dataset** (**Top-View** **R**easoning in **S**pace), comprising 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either _photo-realistic_ or _semantic_ top-view maps of real-world scenarios
> * Investigate 10 VLMs from different model families and sizes, highlighting the _performance gap_ compared to human annotators.
